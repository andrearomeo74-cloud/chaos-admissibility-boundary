# Chaos as an Admissibility Boundary

*A Congruity 7.0 regime analysis*

---

## Overview

Chaos is traditionally described as a property of deterministic systems
exhibiting extreme sensitivity to initial conditions.

In this repository, chaos is reframed not as a dynamical anomaly,
but as an **admissibility boundary**:
a regime in which underlying dynamics remain deterministic,
yet stable, predictive, and compressible descriptions
can no longer persist.

Chaos is treated here as a **limit of viable description**, 
not a failure of physical law.

## Core Hypothesis

A system is **admissible** only while its description satisfies
bounded proportionality between:

- **E** — Energy required to sustain the description  
- **I** — Informational resolution and precision  
- **S** — Structural stability of the representation  
- **V** — Functional or predictive value of the description  

When informational and structural costs grow faster than predictive value,
descriptions lose admissibility.

Chaos marks the regime where this loss becomes unavoidable.

## Admissibility Condition (Canonical Form)

Within the Congruity framework, descriptive viability is preserved only while:

C = V / (E + I + S)

remains bounded and stable.

In chaotic regimes:
- E and S remain finite and well-defined
- I grows exponentially due to sensitivity to initial conditions
- V (predictive usefulness) saturates or collapses

Chaos emerges when the informational burden required to distinguish
nearby trajectories exceeds the structural capacity of any stable description.

This marks an admissibility boundary, not a breakdown of determinism.

## Chaos as a Boundary Phenomenon

Within this framing:

- Dynamics remain deterministic  
- Governing equations remain valid  
- Causality is preserved  

What fails is **descriptive viability**.

Prediction collapses not because outcomes are undetermined,
but because alternative trajectories cannot be
simultaneously resolved, stored, and stabilized
under finite informational and structural constraints.

Chaos is therefore not generated —
it is **selected** as the only remaining regime
when admissibility constraints are exceeded.

## Relation to Classical Chaos Theory

This framework does **not** replace classical chaos theory.

Instead, it provides a higher-level interpretation:

- Sensitivity to initial conditions reflects informational amplification  
- Lyapunov exponents signal rate of admissibility loss  
- Long-term unpredictability results from descriptive overload,
  not from indeterminism  

Chaos indicators diagnose the boundary;
they do not cause it.

## Relation to Other Admissibility Boundaries

This repository is structurally aligned with:

- **Measurement Problem Boundary**  
  (closure of informational descriptions in quantum systems)

- **Arrow of Time Boundary**  
  (irreversibility emerging from closure constraints)

Together, these works identify a common principle:
only descriptions that can close, persist, and stabilize
remain observable.

## What This Repository Is Not

- Not a new dynamical theory  
- Not a predictive or computational model  
- Not a numerical chaos solver  
- Not a modification of physical laws  

This work introduces **no new equations**.

It defines a conceptual boundary condition.

## Status

**Stable conceptual draft.**

Closed unless new admissibility regimes are identified.
